### Frequency Analysis of Light Transport

Frequency analysis of light transport is a theoretical framework to enables to
predict the local behaviour of light during its transport (after multiple
reflexion/refraction/scattering). Because of its predictive nature, this tool
can be used to predict denoising kernels for unconverged light transport
simulation or to adapt the sampling budget locally.
